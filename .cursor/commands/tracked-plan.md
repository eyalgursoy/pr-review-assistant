Use the development-plan-tracking skill (plan / tasks / summary in docs/).

- If starting a NEW initiative: create the three files (plan, tasks, summary) in docs/ using the initiative name I give below. Follow the structure from existing initiatives like ai-review-context or pr-comments-filter-hierarchy.
- If continuing an EXISTING initiative: read the summary file first, then the tasks file, then execute the next task from the plan and update both tracking files when done.
