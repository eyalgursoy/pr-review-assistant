# Version Management

Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## Version Bump Rules

| Bump | When | Examples |
|------|------|----------|
| MAJOR | Breaking changes | Removing features, changing APIs |
| MINOR | New features | New commands, settings, UI panels |
| PATCH | Bug fixes, small improvements | Error fixes, new scripts, tweaks |
| NONE | Docs-only, refactoring | README typos, internal changes |

## Files to Update When Bumping

1. **package.json** - `version` field
2. **README.md** - Version in install example: `pr-review-assistant-X.X.X.vsix`
3. **CHANGELOG.md** - Entry under `[Unreleased]`

## Release Process

After committing with version bump:

```bash
npm run release
```

This tags the current version and pushes to trigger the GitHub release workflow.

## Current Version

Check `package.json` for current version before changes.
